    "To evaluate whether your linear regression model for predicting student performance is good, we should consider several aspects based on the code you've provided and the context. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Preparation\n",
    "Data Wrangling: You encoded categorical variables correctly, ensuring that the model can use them.\n",
    "Correlation Heatmap: This is a good first step to understand relationships between features and the target variable.\n",
    "2. Model Choice\n",
    "Linear Regression: This is a straightforward and interpretable model. However, its performance depends on the underlying assumptions (linearity, homoscedasticity, normality of residuals, etc.).\n",
    "Baseline Model: Comparing the model to a baseline (mean prediction) is a good practice to assess improvement.\n",
    "3. Model Training\n",
    "Fitting the Model: You fit the model on the training data, which is essential. The coefficients and intercept are printed, indicating you've understood the feature contributions.\n",
    "4. Feature Importance\n",
    "Coefficients: The feature importance is derived from the coefficients of the linear regression model. This provides insight into which features have the most significant impact on the target variable.\n",
    "5. Performance Evaluation\n",
    "Mean Absolute Error: While you calculate the MAE for the baseline, you should also compute the MAE for your model predictions to compare.\n",
    "Next Steps for Evaluation\n",
    "Calculate Model MAE:\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "Run\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "y_pred = model.predict(X_train)\n",
    "mae_model = mean_absolute_error(y_train, y_pred)\n",
    "print(f\"MAE of the model: {mae_model}\")\n",
    "Check Residuals:\n",
    "Plotting residuals can help check for patterns. Ideally, residuals should be randomly distributed.\n",
    "Cross-Validation:\n",
    "Consider using cross-validation to get a more reliable estimate of model performance.\n",
    "Model Assumptions:\n",
    "Check for linearity, multicollinearity (using VIF), and homoscedasticity.\n",
    "Feature Scaling (if necessary):\n",
    "If features have different scales, consider standardizing them, especially if you plan to use regularization techniques like Ridge regression.\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "If the MAE of your model is significantly lower than that of the baseline and the residuals show no patterns, you likely have a good model.\n",
    "However, if the model performance is not satisfactory, consider exploring other models (like Ridge regression, Random Forest, etc.) or feature engineering to improve predictions.\n",
    "By following these evaluation steps, you can better determine the effectiveness of your model for predicting student performance."
